# Single Resource Project Prep

Welcome to the Single Resource Project! We're excited to see you embark on this new project. Teamwork and effective collaboration will be key to its success. Remember, effective group work involves delegating responsibilities and meeting agreed-upon deadlines.

## Assignment Requirements

Your prep assignment submission should include the following components, which can be distributed among team members:

### 1. Trello Board
Create a Trello board that includes all project members (including instructors). Use the board to outline your project plan, tasks, and progress. This will serve as a dynamic tool for task management and collaboration.

### 2. Delegated Tasks
Assign specific tasks to each team member. Define roles and responsibilities, ensuring everyone has a clear understanding of their contributions. This will foster efficient teamwork and individual accountability. Each task should detail a User Story that explains a desired feature. Each member of the team must be assigned at least one user story to work on over the course of the project.

### 3. Component Architecture
Diagram your component architecture. Clearly define how components will interact, including how state and props will flow. This visual representation will help you better understand the structure of your application.

### 4. Wireframes
Develop wireframes for both mobile and desktop views. Consider different screen sizes for tablets, desktops, and phones. This will guide your UI design and ensure a consistent user experience across devices.

### 5. Group Norms
Establish a set of group norms that outline how you'll communicate, make decisions, and handle conflicts. Clear norms will enhance collaboration and create a positive working environment. This is a contract that you will all agree upon to work together on this project. It should include:

- When you will meet during the break to work
- How you choose to communicate (e.g., Slack, Email)
- Deliverables - what each team member is responsible for delivering over the break

Use this [worksheet to help establish your team norms](https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/the-real-world-guide-to-team-norms/).


### 6. Entity Relationship Diagrams
Create Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) to represent the relationships between different entities in your database. This will help you plan and visualize how data will be structured and connected.
